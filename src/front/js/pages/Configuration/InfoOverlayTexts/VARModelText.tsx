          The VAR(p) (Vector AutoRegression) model is a model, designed for
          predicting multiple time series at once. It considers that each
          variable in the series affects and is affected by the others. Key
          points:

                <strong>Multivariate Time Series.</strong> Unlike AR, which
                predicts a single time series, VAR predicts multiple time series
                simultaneously.
                {'\n'}
                <em>Example:</em> Imagine we would like to predict both
                temperature and humidity, considering how they influence each
                other.

                <strong>Lagged Observations (p).</strong> The parameter ùëù p
                indicates how many past observations of each variable are used
                to predict the current value.
                {'\n'}
                <em>Example:</em> If ùëù = 2, we use the values from these last
                two time points to predict the next one.

        If the series are stationary, we forecast them by fitting a VAR to the
        data right away. If the time series are non-stationary, we take
        differences of the data in order to make them stationary, and then
        proceed with fit a VAR model.
